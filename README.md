# Random Imputation
In this version, the 0 values were replaced with random values using random imputation. The resulting accuracy score for the model remained unchanged compared to when observations with 0 values were eliminated.
 I employed random imputation to replace the 0 values present in the dataset. By introducing random values in place of the 0s, I aimed to retain the integrity of the dataset and prevent the exclusion of observations.

Surprisingly, even with the introduction of these random values, the resulting accuracy score for the model remained unchanged compared to the previous approach, where observations with 0 values were eliminated. This demonstrates the robustness of the model in handling missing or imputed values while maintaining a consistent level of performance.

Ultimately, this model achieved an impressive accuracy score of 90%, reaffirming its ability to effectively classify the given dataset.
