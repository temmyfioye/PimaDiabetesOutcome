# Pima Diabetes Outcome Analysis with Logistic Regression

The purpose of this analysis is to apply logistic regression to a dataset to predict the outcome of diabetes. The dataset used in this analysis contains various features related to individuals' health and the target variable represents the presence or absence of diabetes.

Logistic regression is a statistical technique commonly used for binary classification problems, making it suitable for predicting the outcome of diabetes in this case. By fitting a logistic regression model to the dataset, we aim to identify the relationship between the input features and the likelihood of having diabetes.

The analysis involves preprocessing the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and then training the logistic regression model on the training data. Once trained, the model will be evaluated using the testing data to assess its predictive performance.

By leveraging logistic regression, this analysis aims to provide insights into the factors that contribute to the occurrence of diabetes. The model's accuracy and other evaluation metrics will help assess its effectiveness in predicting diabetes outcomes and potentially guide further investigation into preventive measures or early intervention strategies.
